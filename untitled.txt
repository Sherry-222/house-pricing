Linear Regression for House Price Prediction

Step 1: The Data

Size (sq.ft)	Price (₹ in lakhs)

 500              25
 1000             50
 1500             75
 2000             100
 2500             125


Step 2: Linear Regression Formula

We try to fit a straight line:

Price = m \times Size + c

Here:

m = slope = how much price increases when size increases.

c = intercept (price when size is 0).


From data, it looks like every 500 sq.ft adds ₹25 lakh.
So slope m = 25 / 500 = 0.05.
Also when size = 0 → price = 0, so c = 0.

So equation is:

Price = 0.05 \times Size



Step 3: Prediction Example

For a house of size 2200 sq.ft:


Price = 0.05 \times 2200 = 110 \text{ lakhs}


Step 4: Epoch vs Accuracy Concept

Epoch = one round of training (algorithm looks at all data once).

With each epoch, the model’s accuracy improves until it stabilizes.


A simple graph:

X-axis → Epochs (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 …)

Y-axis → Accuracy (0.6, 0.7, 0.8 … 1.0)


Draw a curve that goes up and then becomes flat:

Accuracy |
    1.0  |                 _________
    0.9  |              __/
    0.8  |           __/
    0.7  |        __/
    0.6  |     __/
    0.5  |/
         ------------------------------
